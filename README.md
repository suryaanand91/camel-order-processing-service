# camel-order-processing-service
The Camel-based Order Processing Service is a streamlined, event-driven integration solution that automates order management by connecting various components and services efficiently. Built on Apache Camel, it leverages routes to orchestrate the journey of customer orders from receipt to dispatch. The service listens to incoming order messages on an ActiveMQ queue, verifies the message structure, and performs necessary validations to ensure data integrity. Valid orders are then persisted in MongoDB for tracking and historical insights. The service then transforms the order data into a dispatch-ready format and forwards it to the dispatch queue, initiating downstream fulfillment workflows. With built-in error handling, modular processors, and dynamic routing capabilities, the Camel-based Order Processing Service delivers reliability, scalability, and seamless integration with other systems, ensuring robust order processing at scale.
